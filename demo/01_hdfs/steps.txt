# Steps for the HDFS demo

# 0. Open a terminal window to this directory.

# 1. List the contents of the root directory in HDFS
# 
hadoop fs -ls /

# 2. Create a new directory named "fast14" below the 
#    /user/training directory in HDFS. Since you're 
#    currently logged in with the "training" user ID, 
#    /user/training is your home directory in HDFS.
#
hadoop fs -mkdir /user/training/fast14

# 3. Add the application.log file from the local directory
#    named "data" to the new directory you created in HDFS
#    during the previous step.
#
hadoop fs -put data/application.log /user/training/fast14

# 4. List the contents of this new directory in HDFS.
#
hadoop fs -ls /user/training/fast14

# 5. Add the entire local directory called "names" to the
#    /user/training directory in HDFS. 
#
hadoop fs -put data/names /user/training

# 6. Since /user/training is your home directory in HDFS,
#    any command that does not have an absolute path is
#    interpreted as relative to that directory. The next
#    command will therefore list your home directory, and
#    should show the items you've just added there.
#
hadoop fs -ls

# 7. Delete a file from the "names" directory.
# 
hadoop fs -rm names/yob2002.txt

# 8. Ensure this file is no longer in HDFS.
#
hadoop fs -ls names/yob2002.txt

# 9. Finally, remove the entire names directory and all
#    of its contents in HDFS.
#
hadoop fs -rm -r names

# 10. List the fast14 directory again to ensure that the 
#     application.log file is still there. We will use 
#     that as input to our MapReduce job in the next demo.
#
hadoop fs -ls fast14
