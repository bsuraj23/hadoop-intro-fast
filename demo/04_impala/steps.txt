# Steps for Impala demo
# This reuses the data and table definition from the 
# Hive demo, so we need only refresh the metadata.

# Step 1: Make sure Impala knows about the table
# created in Hive
#
impala-shell -q 'INVALIDATE METADATA'

# Step 2: Run the same queries as in Hive.
#
echo "Calculating the number of unique baby names"
impala-shell -q "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM names"

echo "Calculating five most popular names for girls that start with 'A'"
impala-shell -q "SELECT name, SUM(qty) AS total FROM names WHERE name LIKE 'A%' AND gender='F' GROUP BY name ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 5"
